    Hi my name is:<br>
    Jordan webster <br>
    I recently decide to have a career change,<br>
    after 10 years of working in the hopitality industry.<br>
    Why is that you ask?<br>
    I decide that i would like to learn to code as everything revolves around the internet aswell as apps these days.<br>
     Whilst i was in school  myspace was the lastest thing about (wait whatttt)<br>
      facebook didnt even exist back then ...<br> 
      I know what your thinking how old is this guy.<br>
      On myspace i enjoyed the fact you could edit your ;music,backgrounds,images<br>
      which is basically the same as creating a web page.<br>
      I have created this website to show my creativity and some of the things i have learned and I am still learning
     </p>
      <h2><b>Skills i am learning currently</b> </h2>
